# Project: Loan Default Prediction 

## Problem Formulation
Banks earn a major revenue from lending loans. But it is often associated with risk. The borrower's may default on the loan. To mitigate this issue, the banks have decided to use Machine Learning to overcome this issue. They have collected past data on the loan borrowers. The dataset is enormous & consists of multiple deterministic factors like borrowe's income, gender, loan pupose etc.

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer will default on the loan or not.

## Hypothesis Generation
This is one of the important stages in any Data Science/Machine Learning pipeline. It involves understanding the problem in detail by brainstorming as many factors as possible which can impact the outcome. It is done by understanding the problem statement thoroughly and before looking at the data.

Below are some of the factors which I think can highly affect the people who default on the loans :

* Age: Mostly elder people or 20s people might not be able to repay the loans as they dont have much incomes.

* Income: Income of a person plays a major role if a person lost his job or got losses on business  then he might be insolvent and he cant able to repay the loan .

* Purpose of the loan: The purpose of a loan will surely impact the person to repay the loan. If he took the loan for personal expenses with out having much financial discipline. 

* Credit Score: People who are having good credit score having less chances of getting default on loan rather than people who dont have good credit score.

## Steps to follow
It is a Binary Classification Problem

General Overview: Have a General Overview of the data

* ##### EDA: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) to gain more clear insights of the data
* ##### Data Preprocessing: With the information gained after performing EDA, Preprocess the Data accordingly
* ##### Model Building: Once the data is properly cleaned and preprocessed, use this data to build a Machine Learning
* ##### Hyperparameter Tuning: Tune the Hyperparameters of the best performing model
* ##### Model Performance: Assess the Performance of the Model on the Testing data set
* ##### Save the model: Save the Best Performing Model
* ##### Predictions: Make Predictions on the Testing data set
